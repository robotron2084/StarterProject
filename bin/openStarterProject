#!/bin/bash
# Whenever I create a project I always create a shell script to open the project.
# This is a simple script but sometimes these scripts might have options such as
# specific branches or other special considerations.
#
# This has the additional benefit that if I hang Unity I can simply Ctrl-C
# and up-arrow to get back to where I was.
#
# I have many, many versions of Unity on my computer, and generally every project
# has a specific version it is coded to. I will frequently upgrade my projects 
# when it is a good time to do so, but I don't like sudden upgrades that 
# break things.
